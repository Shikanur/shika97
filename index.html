                    work, or simply
                    lack of desire.
                <aside>And I didn't want anything special.
                    but since last year I have been dying just
                    thinking about how beautiful our planet is and I
                    can’t wait to see all the beautiful places on it.
                    and here comes the reason why I want to change
                    my profession, starting to do something
                    completely foreign to me, but which brings me
                    so much pleasure and also gives me the
                    opportunity to travel in the future and at the
                    same time work remotely.
                    Below you can see an incomplete list of things
                    I’ve been trying to do and then places I visited,
                    am crazy about and want to visit no matter the
                    cost.

                    live once and we must live in such a way that there are no regrets later. one must live, not just
                    exist. and after I understood this, <br>
                    I realized that I wanted to live; my soul became so calm. I really like the way I think now, how I
